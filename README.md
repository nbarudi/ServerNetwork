# Server 'Gimmick'
## Leveling System
    - Each server will have 1 combined leveling service
    - Levels will allow you to unlock restricted features depending on which server you play on
    - Levels are gained in multiple different ways
      - Each method if gaining a level requires you to gain an ever increasing amount of experience based on which level you are trying to obtain
        - (1000 -> LvL 2 | 1250 -> LvL 3 | 1500 -> LvL 4 | etc..)
    - Levels are planned to be gained using one of these methods:
      - Killing mobs >>
        - Killing any Friendly, Neutral or, Hostile mob in Survival / Hardcore survival will gain you a pre set amount of experience.
        - Killing monsters in RDvZ will also gain experience
          - (As well as monsters killing dwarves will gain extra)
      - Completing a gamemode >>
        - Finishing 1 round of RDvZ will gain you a set amount of experience
        - Finishing 1 round of Mafia will gain you experience
        - Winning 1 round of Mafia will gain you extra experience
### Leveling in Survival / Hardcore
    - Each level will gain the user 1 SP (Skill Point)
      - Skill points can be used to unlock extra abilities / perks that are usable in survival
      - Perks may consist of >>
        - Keep Inventory
        - Keep Experience
        - Auto Smelt
        - Extra Fortune
        - Permanent Potion Effects
        - Flight
        - Extra Block Claims
        - *More to come*
    - Leveling up will gain the player extra claim blocks for survival

    **Hardcore Specific**
    - Skill points are gained at the same rate
    - Perks cost more (how much unknown) to purchase with SP
    - Players can buy more lives with their SP 
       (Cost to be set based on balance as time goes on)

## Plans will change as time goes on depending on new ideas, server plans, and balance changes.
