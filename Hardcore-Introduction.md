[Information] (Hover: Simple Introduction / Information about the game!)
Welcome to the Hardcore Server (Hover: Created By nbarudi#0001)!

The game is very simple! You have 3 Lives! Lose all 3 lives, and lose your ability to play!
(Basically just normal hardcore except instead of 1 life and dead, you are given 3)

Now that being said, this doesn't mean that once you've lost lives its its over for you.
There are 2 up sides to this fact.
1. You can Craft or Buy Lives!
   Lives can be purchases in the Shop!
   Lives can also be crafted using some custom items! 
   Search Life in your Recipe Book to see how!
   
2. Worst case you lose all your lives? What Happens Next?
   Simple! Just wait! If you lose all your lives all you need to do is wait!
   You will automatically be revived after a set amount of time!
   Then you are free to rejoin the server and you can Craft/Buy more lives!

So what do you have to keep in mind?

Every time you lose all your lives your time to revive increases!
The starting time for a revive is 12 hours.
Each time you lose all lives, this time increases by 12 hours.

Dont want to wait for your time limit? Well we have a solution to that to!
Take a run to our website to learn more! xxxxxxxxxx (Hover: Open Link To Website)
